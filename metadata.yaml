description: 'Many believe that each human being is surrounded by a metaphysical emanation
  that surrounds the body, a luminous nebula of color and light that is known as an
  ''aura.'' The Human Aura: Astral Colors and Thought Forms, written by William Walker
  Atkinson, offers a comprehensive introduction to the subject and assists readers
  in the perception and analysis of auras.'
